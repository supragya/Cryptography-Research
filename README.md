# Cryptography-Research
![CI Status](https://github.com/supragya/research/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)

A single repository that hosts my "in-code" research of: protocols, ZK, cryptography, rust etc.

## Browsing the codebase
The codebase is mostly split into different directories depending on the specific ideas that they tackle. While mostly consistent with this scheme, there may be deviations. Download the codebase locally and run as follows:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:supragya/Cryptography-Research.git
cd Cryptography-Research && cargo test
```
