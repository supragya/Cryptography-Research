![CI Status](https://github.com/supragya/research/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)

A single repository that hosts my "in-code" research of: protocols, ZK, cryptography, rust etc.

## On lower level zero-knowledge elements
- [univariate-polynomial-iop-zerotest](./univariate-polynomial-iop-zerotest): Polynomial IOP test that $f(x)$'s evaluation on $k$-sized subgroup of a finite field of prime order is all zero.

## Zero-knowledge circuit creation
- [halo2-trials)(./halo2-trials): A simple tutorial for writing a basic `halo2` circuit for ZCash.
