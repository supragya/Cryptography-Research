# Univariate Polynomial Interactive Oracle Proof for Zero Testing

This sub-repo contains code for testing that a univariate polynomial $f(x)$ has evaluation $f(x) = 0$ for all $\Omega = \{{\omega, \omega^2, ..., \omega^{k-1}\}}$. The elements in $\Omega$ are assumed to be finite cyclic group in a prime field $F_p$ such that $\omega^k = 1 \mod{p}$. $\omega$ in this case would be called the $k$-th root of unity under $F_p$.
